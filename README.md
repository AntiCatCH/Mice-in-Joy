--- Mice in Joy ---

--- DESCRIPTION:

Mice in Joy is a little piece of software designed with simplicity in mind,
meaning that I tried to do this with the least possible ammount of code, which
in turn means that it has little features too.

--- COMPILING AND INSTALLING/RUNNING:

First of all, change the variables necessary on the Makefile, change the three
$DEF variables to point towards the correct paths, change the HOST variable to
your desired host platform. (empty if you're targeting your current arch), now 
just run make and copy the binary where you want it to be.

You can customize the driver by changing the polling rate and sensivity (sic)
on the analog.conf file, which should be placed on your home folder.
